		<h1 class="para">Putting everything together!</h1>
		<p id="intro" class="para">
			  Lets get that other data we wanted! Let's begin with the beer label. It should be easy to find. Theres a grouping
			  called labels in data, and contained within that is the link to three images, named icon, medium, and large. So
			  Let's get the medium size one and display it. First in our html document we add something like this:

		</p>
		<pre class="prettyprint">
			<xmp><img id=beerImg><img></xmp>
		</pre>
	</div>
	
	<div class="col">
		<h3 class="para"></h3>
		<p class="para">
			Now that we have that, we can set a source for it in our JavaScript! We can add something like this to our code that
			determines what we do with the search request data:
		</p>
		<pre class="prettyprint">
			document.getElementById("beerImg").src = response.data[0].labels.medium;
		</pre>
		
		<p class="para">
			This gets the image url from the response and stores it as the source, so now the proper label will show up in that location!
			You can do the same with the brewery logo ID, but this one will have to be added after the second request, since we don't get
			any brewery info until then. What we finally want to get is the address of the brewery. There's a number of parts to the address
			that we can see from the results. The street address, city, state, and zipcode are all different items, so let's create a variable
			for each of those and combine them into a full address. I've picked locations[0] here since that is generally the main brewery.
		</p>
		<pre class="prettyprint">
			var street = response2.data.breweries[0].locations[0].streetAddress;
			var city = response2.data.breweries[0].locations[0].locality;
			var state = response2.data.breweries[0].locations[0].region;
			var zip = response2.data.breweries[0].locations[0].postalCode;
			var fullAddr = street + ', ' + city + ', ' + state + ' ' + zip;
			document.getElementById("loc").textContent = fullAddr;

		</pre>
		
		<p class="para">
			So now we have a nice, readable address, as well as the images that we wanted! You could then take all of this information to get 
			even more than that! Now, there is a way to add brewery info to your results in the first search, but I left it out for demonstration
			purposes. Also, be mindful of how many nested requests you make. You may run out of your 400 daily requests quicker than you'd like, not
			to mention it might make for a sluggish experience because the wait times will add up quickly! With what you've learned 
			here, you should be able to get all of the info you could want about beers and breweries! You can try out the above example below, try searching
			"Two Hearted Ale" or any beer of your choice!
