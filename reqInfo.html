			So far we got a beer name and an ID. We can do better than that! If you noticed earlier, when we searched for
			a beer, the results didn't include a brewery. But lets say we really want to know who makes our favorite beer,
			and where their brewery is. This leads us to:

		</p>
		
	</div>
	
	<div class="col">
		<h3 class="para">Nested AJAX requests</h3>
		<p class="para">
			We need to make a new request if we want to find this brewery info. The beer search results page has no info on the
			brewery. But we know <i>BreweryDB</i> has to have that info somewhere. This is where the id we got earlier is useful.
			Using that id, we can get a more comprehensive data set of that particular beer. Now that we know the specific id of 
			our beer, we can get results for that one specifically. Lets start to make our new url for that request. We still have
			our old variables from the first call, but we're gonna make a few new ones.
			

		</p>
		
		<pre class="prettyprint">
			var beer = /beer/;
			var brew = "?withBreweries=y";
			var id = response.data[0].id;
			var newUrl = base + beer + id + brew + key;

		</pre>
		<p class="para">
			Here we have added a few more variables. The beer variable replaces the search variable. We're not doing a search anymore,
			were getting info for a specific beer, so /beer is how we indicate that. We have a new id variable. This will store the
			id that we found earlier from the search. Notice how we're using the first response to fill in the data for our next request.
			The brew variable indicates an optional addition that we can add. Normally the beer data returns without brewery info. But
			here we have added withBreweries=y to ensure we get what we want. There are many more of these options for most of the calls
			you can make, and they are all addressed in the full documentation. Finally, we have the newUrl, which puts these all together.
			Now we can simply make a new request, right? But be careuful, because where you put the request is important.
		</p>
		
		<h3 class="para">A Call Inside of a Call</h3>
		<p class="para">
			In our first request, we added an event listener to make sure we actually got the data before it started storing the info
			in variables and outputting to our html document. Since one of our variables (the id variable) is made from the result of that 
			call, our subsequent request must also wait until the first is finished loading. So let's take a big look at our Javascript code
			up to this point.

		</p>
		
		<pre class="prettyprint">
			
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', bind); //DOM must load first before binding buttons.

function bind(){
    var el = document.getElementById('beerSub');
    el.addEventListener('click', function(event){
		var base = "http://api.brewerydb.com/v2"
        var beerName = document.getElementById('br').value;
        var bts = beerName.split(' ').join('_');
        var type = "&type=beer";
        var key = "&key=d9e3c76540e2267dd4f9e09ede879957";
        var search = "/search?q=";
        var fullUrl = base + search + bts + type + key; //construct a custom url based on the user's input
        var req = new XMLHttpRequest(); //create the request with the new url
        req.open("GET", fullUrl, true);
        
        req.send(null);
        req.addEventListener('load', function(){
            var response = JSON.parse(req.responseText); //parse the response text
            document.getElementById("sb").textContent = response.data[0].name;         
            document.getElementById("id").textContent = response.data[0].id;
            document.getElementById("try1").textContent = response.data[1].name;
            document.getElementById("try2").textContent = response.data[2].name;
            
        });
        event.preventDefault();
    });
}

		</pre>
		<p class="para">
			Now, where to put the next request? As mentioned before, if we put it anywhere after the req.addEventListener function,
			then it very well may execute before the first request is done loading. This is the nature of Asynchronous requests. While
			that specific request loads, so too does the rest of the stuff below it. Only what is in the anonymous function below it
			waits for it to load. So that is where we must put the new request. Our new request is going to look something like this:

		</p>
		<pre class="prettyprint">
	    var beer = /beer/;
            var brew = "?withBreweries=y"
            var id = response.data[0].id;
            var newUrl = base + beer + id + brew + key
            var req2 = new XMLHttpRequest();
            req2.open("GET", newUrl, true);
            req2.send(null);
            req2.addEventListener('load', function(){
                var response2 = JSON.parse(req2.responseText); //parse the response tex
                console.log(response2);
                document.getElementById("brew").textContent = response2.data.breweries[0].name;
           
            
        });
		</pre>
		<p class="para">
			This should be pretty familiar, its just like the request we made the first time. We open the new request, send
			our url, and add an event listener to wait until its loaded, then populate our stuff with data! Here's how the 
			full file might look, with the requests properly nested:

		</p>
		<pre class="prettyprint">
			
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', bind); 

function bind(){
    var el = document.getElementById('beerSub');
    el.addEventListener('click', function(event){
		var base = "http://api.brewerydb.com/v2"
        var beerName = document.getElementById('br').value;
        var bts = beerName.split(' ').join('_');
        var type = "&type=beer";
        var key = "&key=d9e3c76540e2267dd4f9e09ede879957";
        var search = "/search?q=";
        var fullUrl = base + search + bts + type + key; 
        var req = new XMLHttpRequest(); 
        req.open("GET", fullUrl, true);
        
        req.send(null);
        req.addEventListener('load', function(){
            var response = JSON.parse(req.responseText); 
            document.getElementById("sb").textContent = response.data[0].name;         
            document.getElementById("id").textContent = response.data[0].id;
            document.getElementById("try1").textContent = response.data[1].name;
            document.getElementById("try2").textContent = response.data[2].name;
		//We begin making the new request here, inside the first!
            var beer = /beer/;  
            var brew = "?withBreweries=y"
            var id = response.data[0].id;
            var newUrl = base + beer + id + brew + key
            var req2 = new XMLHttpRequest();
            req2.open("GET", newUrl, true);
            req2.send(null);
            req2.addEventListener('load', function(){
                var response2 = JSON.parse(req2.responseText); 
                console.log(response2);
                document.getElementById("brew").textContent = response2.data.breweries[0].name; 
	    });
            
        });
        event.preventDefault();
    });
}
		</pre>
		<p class="para">
			With this concept, you should be able to derive a ton of data from what you get. To finish things off, let's make
			our search really cool! Lets add image of the beer label, the address of the brewery, and an image of the brewery label! 
			You should be able to do all of this on your own now, but if not, we'll step through it on the final page!
