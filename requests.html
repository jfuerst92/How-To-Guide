		<h1 class="para">Making your first request</h1>
		<p id="intro" class="para">
			We’ll be making GET requests to get data from the database. That mean’s we’re going to pass 
			information in the url. Here is an example:
		</p>
		
	</div>
	
	<div class="col">
		<h3 class="para">http://api.brewerydb.com/v2/search?q=Two_Hearted_Ale&type=beer&key=YOUR_API_KEY</h3>
		<p class="para">
			This url looks long and confusing, so we’ll break it down into easier to understand parts.

		</p>
		
	</div>
	<div class="col">
		<h3 class="para">http://api.brewerydb.com/v2</h3>
		<p class="para">
			This is the base url. Every call you make will include this part. v2 stands for the new version 
			that they put out, as there is an older outdated version still used by some. Use this to be 
			future-proof. 
		</p>
		
	</div>
	<div class="col">
		<h3 class="para">/search</h3>
		<p class="para">
			This is what we want to get. In this specific case, we want to do a search. But there are many 
			others, such as /beer to get a list of all beers, /breweries to get a list of all breweries, or 
			/brewery/:breweryId if you wanted to get a specific item. There are a lot of these, and we’ll go 
			over some of the more common ones soon.
		</p>		
	</div>
	
	<div class="col">
		<h3 class="para">?q=Two_Hearted_Ale&type=beer</h3>
		<p class="para">
			These are our queries. In this specific case it’s what we’re searching for. 
			I am looking for a specific beer. I am searching for beers with names that match 
			Two Hearted Ale, and  I am telling the database that beer is what Im looking for when 
			I put type=beer. Each pair is seperated by an &.
		</p>		
	</div>
	
	<div class="col">
		<h3 class="para">&key=YOUR_API_KEY</h3>
		<p class="para">
			Following the last ampersand will be something like this, 
			but instead of YOUR_API_KEY you would write in the API key 
			that was given to you in the email. That way they know who 
			the request is coming from. It won’t work if you don’t have one. 

		</p>	
		<p class="para">
			So now, do it with me! put in your api key, and copy and paste the url into your address bar in a browser. 
			If you did it right, you’ll get something like this:
			<img class="pic" src="JSONresponseMess.png" alt="Requesting an API key" style="width:1200px;height:800px;">
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="col">
		
		<p class="para">
			Yikes! That’s a big chunk of data! If you find this representation of the data hard to swallow 
			(and you should), then copy all of that garbage and  head over here - http://jsonviewer.stack.hu/. 
			Paste it into the text area, and go over to the viewer, and you’ll see the data is all neatly tucked 
			away in a JSON object and now in a format that you can actually begin to comprehend. It should look 
			something like this: 
		</p>	
		
			<img class="pic" src="JSONresponseOrdered.png" alt="Requesting an API key" style="width:1200px;height:800px;">
		<p class="para">
			As you move around and explore what’s in this, you’ll notice that it’s just a list of beers that have 
			similar names to the one we searched. The first result is a perfect match, and you can see there are 
			bunch of key:value pairs, such as "id":"Kk1Cyr","name":"Two Hearted Ale" and more, including a 
			description, optimal drinking temperature, optimal glass, food pairings, brewery and much much more! 
			Now we can get the data we need through these pairs, and display those results on our site, or use that 
			info to make further requests! This tutorial isn’t going to dive into exactly what JSON is, since it’s 
			out of the scope of what  you need to know to get things working, but if you want more information, 
			head over to <a href="http://json.org/">JSON.org</a>. 

		</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="col">
		<h3 class="para">Making the request</h3>
		<p class="para">
			Now, in order to get this data in a useable form, were going to make an AJAX request. 
			AJAX stands for asynchronous JavaScript and XML. So here we’re gonna need a bit of javascript. 
			First, I’ll show you an example! Below is a form that will send an AJAX request. It uses the same
			exact url that we broke down earlier, but now, it returns the search result data of the beer you enter 
			and displays to you what the top result's name and id, along with the names of the 2nd and 3rd closest 
			results. 

		</p>		
	</div>
<div>	
	<h3>Search For a beer</h3>
		<p>
			Enter the name of a beer:
		</p>
	<form method="post">
		<fieldset>
			<label for="br">Beer: </label>
			<input type = "text" name="br" id="br">
			<input type = "submit" name="submit_beer" id="beerSub">
		</fieldset>
	</form>
	<ul>
		<li><span>Beer Searched: </span><span id="sb"></span></li>
		<li><span>Beer ID: </span><span id="id"></span></li>
	</ul>
	<p>Beer with similar names:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><span>Try: </span><span id="try1"></span></li>
		<li><span>Try: </span><span id="try2"></span></li>
	</ul>
</div>
	
<div class="col">
		<h3 class="para">Pretty cool, right?</h3>
		<p class="para">
			Now let's take a look at what the javascript is doing to make this happen. The first thing we want
			to do is to make a couple variables that will hold the parts of the url that we're going to send.

		</p>	
		<pre class="prettyprint">
			var baseUrl = "http://api.brewerydb.com/v2";
			var search = "/search?q=";
			var beerName = "Two Hearted Ale"
			var type = "&type=beer";
			var key = "&key=YOUR_API_KEY";
			var fullUrl = baseUrl + search + beerName + type + key;
		</pre>
	</div>
	
	<div class="col">
		
		<p class="para">
			The fullUrl variable now contains the entire url, just as we used earlier. (For the record, Bell's
			Two Hearted Ale is my personal favorite, so that's my example beer.) You may be wondering why I went
			through all that work to join the variables together to make a url, when I could have just put the 
			whole text in the fullUrl variable to begin with. The reason for this is that you may want the user to
			decide what is to be stored in the variable, rather than having it hard coded, so for instance, beerName
			could be written like this:
		</p>	
		<pre class="prettyprint">
			var beerName = document.getElementById('br').value;
		</pre>
		<p class="para">
			Now, if you have a text entry field in your html document that has the id 'br', beerName will store that
			variable when it is entered.
		</p>
		<p class="para">
			But still, something is not quite right about this. You don't generally see spaces in your urls, do you?
			So if the user types "Two Hearted Ale" in and tries to enter that, the url you try to send will look like this:
		</p>
		<p class="para">	
			http://api.brewerydb.com/v2/search?q=Two Hearted Ale&type=beer&key=YOUR_API_KEY
		</p>
		<p class="para">	
		 That simply won't do. In fact, the proper url needs underscores instead of spaces. 
		So you're going to have to fix what the user enters, because it would be rude to expect
		 them to know to use underscores when you are searching a beer with more than one word!
		 So instead you can do something like this:
		</p>
		<pre class="prettyprint">
			
			var beerName = document.getElementById('br').value;
			var bts = beerName.split(' ').join('_');
			
		</pre>
		<p class="para">	
			This will essentially replace the spaces with underscores. Now you can add that to the url, and it will 
			actually work!
		</p>
		<pre class="prettyprint">
			var fullUrl = baseUrl + search + bts + type + key;
		</pre>
		
		<p class="para">	
			The final variable that we need is here:
		</p>
		<pre class="prettyprint">
			 var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
		</pre>
		<p class="para">	
			This assigns a new JavaScript object that facilitates the sending of our AJAX request to the req variable.
			Now we will work with this variable to send our stuff and get back what we want! Next we want to "open" a 
			request. We can do that like so:
		</p>
		
		<pre class="prettyprint">
			 req.open("GET", fullUrl, true);
		</pre>
		<p class="para">	
			This bit sends the request. It has three arguments. For the first we wrote "GET", indicating tthat this would
			be a GET request. The second argument is the url that we have constructed, and the third argument is true, which
			indicates that we want an asynchronous request. Since it's asynchronous, we need to add an event listener.
		</p>
		<pre class="prettyprint">
		req.addEventListener('load', function(){
			 var response = JSON.parse(req.responseText); //parse the response text
			 console.log(response);
			 document.getElementById("sb").textContent = response.data[0].name;        
			 document.getElementById("id").textContent = response.data[0].id;
			 document.getElementById("try1").textContent = response.data[1].name;
			 document.getElementById("try2").textContent = response.data[2].name;           
		 });
		</pre>
		<p class="para">	
			This event listener waits for it to complete loading, so that all of the data is there, and only when it is, 
			it executes the function. This function parses the response text and stores it in the variable response. And 
			once it does that, you can do whatever you like with the data! The first thing I did here was to log the variable.
			So if you entered a beer in the example earlier, then you can press F12 to open the console and view the data, just 
			as you did earlier with the JSON viewer. Below the log statement, you can see how I got the info to output on this 
			page. This page contains elements with the ids: "sb, "id", "try1" and "try 2". The first statement stored 
			response.data[0].name in the textContent of that element. If you searched Two Hearted Ale, then the top result is, unsuprisingly,
			Two Hearted Ale. response.data[0].id refers to the beer id that the database uses. This will be useful later. The next two refer
			to the next two results in the search. Using this notation, you could access any part of any of the beers returned in the search.
			And there are a lot, so that's pretty cool.
		</p>
		<p class="para">	
			Now, remember that chrome add-on I had you install earlier? Now's the time to explain why that is necessary.
