			If you’re absolutely brand new to API’s then this part will hopefully get you started. 
			It’s a brief overview of API’s and what exactly they do. If you’re cool with all of this, 
			then skip ahead to the next step and get ready to dive into BreweryDB!

		<p class="para">
			API stands for Application Program Interface. It’s essentially a way to give
			you an easy way to access massive amounts of information or functionality that 
			you do not already have. For example, let’s say you want to have a youtube video 
			on your page, or you want to have GPS maps functionality on your page, or you just 
			want to get the temperature in Siberia. These problems are (probably) a lot bigger 
			than you have the resources to handle. Most of us don’t have a great Idea whats 
			happening behind the scenes on YouTube, we don’t own satellites to implement GPS 
			tracking, and we certainly don’t know anyone in Siberia!
		</p>
		<p class="para">
			Thankfully, other people online make this stuff available for you! Youtube has an API that allows you to 
			easily embed videos on your own site. Google does the same with Google Maps. And 
			you can get weather info from anywhere in the world with a weather API. You do 
			this by asking nicely, through a request. You make a request and send it to the 
			url that said API provides, and they send back a nice chunk of data that your website 
			can process and spit out to the user. It tucks away a lot of complexity, and can 
			make your websites much more powerful! Now you can finally get an actual example 
			of this through the tutorial. If you’re ready to get started, click next! Otherwise, 
			there are a ton of great resources online to tell you all about APIs!
