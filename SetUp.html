			Now, there are a few things we must get out of the way before we begin.
			To start, you're going to want to be using chrome. It's not necessary 
			to use the API, but it is if you want to interact with this tutorial.
			The second thing you must do is to install and activate <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi" target="_blank">this</a>.
			This handly little tool makes it so that your browser won't block the stuff 
			that gets returned from cross domain ajax requests. That stuff is the beer 
			info that we really want! So for the sake of this tutorial, it's needed.
			We'll get into why this is necessary later, but for now, just understand that
			in the name of security, the developers of the BreweryDB API don't allow your
			browser to view stuff that is returned from a request to a different domain.
		</p>
		<p id="intro2" class="para">
			Once you have all of this done, you're ready to start learning about what BreweryDB
			is and How you're supposed to use it!

		<h3 class="para">Tutorial Plans</h3>
		<p class="para">
			This tutorial is going to first go through the basics of using 
			an API, then we will dive into BreweryDB to figure out how to 
			search for specific beers, get information about those beers, 
			and use that information to get even more delicious information 
			about our favorite beers!

			Now, the full documentation above is certainly thorough. 
			But it is a lot of information to swallow at once, and 
			could very easily leave someone confused especially 
			because of the plethora of options available. So we’re 
			gonna start small, we’ll learn specifically how to search 
			for a specific beer by name, get some information from it, 
			specifically but not exclusively the brewery that produces it, 
			and from there we’ll get a bunch of other beers that that 
			brewery makes! Consider it a sort of “Suggestion” based on what 
			you input.
